The app has multiple different functions such as the ability to
create a course (or to, alternatively, enter one if it is already created)
or even remove one. After selecting the course, we get the ability to
add or modify a student's information, as well as add or modify a category.
We can also view the student's grades as well as add some
and calculate the final report.

There are 3 main pages to the form.
One of them is the page where you select the course.
The second one is where you add/modify students and categories,
as well as calculate the final report for the selected course.
The third page is the one where you are able to see a selected
student's grades as well as modify them and add new ones.
There are also two forms which appear whenever you create a new student
or modify/create a new category. Everything is accessible by buttons
and some things have to be entered with textboxes while others can just
be done with comboboxes.

The files with all of the information that are created can be viewed by going
into the FinalProject folder. After that, we navigate to the binfolder,
followed by the Debug folder. The files are going to be either in the Final Report
folder, for the final reports, or the Data folder, for the other files
such as the personal student files, the category files, the students per class files
and the Courses file.

There are back buttons in order to be able to navigate back to the main menu and there is
a possibility to close the newly appeared forms if you change your mind about creating
a new student or a new category.
